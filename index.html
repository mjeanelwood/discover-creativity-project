            <h3>What is creativity?</h3>
            <p>
              There are numerous definitions and opinions as to what creativity
              is. For some it follows artistic traits such as writing &
              painting. Others can be technically creative finding new ways to
              improve the "mouse trap" or inventing a new one. Creativity can be
              seen as an ability; you can either have a natural ability to
              perform, or you can learn and improve on what you have.
            </p>
            <p>
              We all have the seed of creativity within us. Some water and feed
              that seed until it grows into something beautiful and wonderous.
              Some will have a seed that only grows to a smaller vision but
              still satisfies that creative desire within themselves. Whatever
              seed of creativity you have within you the important thing to
              remember is to <strong><em>have fun with it</em></strong
              >!
